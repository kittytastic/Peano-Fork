The other operations are spawned as background tasks. A second traversal then gathers the outcomes of these background tasks, i.e. is, more or less, a sole tidy-up sweep. I remove the solvers first and add this new type of enclave solver. I give it the same name as our first solver. The enclave solver is a cousin to the plain one and uses exactly the same signature. We have manually written some flux and eigenvalue functions before. These one thus will then automatically be used here: We specity a solver called Euler, the toolkit will create all solver infrastructure, but it will not overwrite anything called Euler.cpp for or Euler.h as it assumes that you've already written some user-specific code. So this implementation is then used for the enclave solver. As I wrote: Works only as plain and enclave solver have exactly the same signature."
