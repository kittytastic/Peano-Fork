# Remove parameters associated with Cactus stuff, and the code that gets activated by them. We won't ever use it.

# Add/remove stdout messages from the code, so that it gives useful and well formatted info. Also make it so that verbose=false
# completely switches off those messages, like a quiet switch.

# Have the code write out the physical properties of the computed data in a separate ASCII file, just like the Cactus version

# Add a parfile parser, so we can read parameters from an external file.

# Clean the code a bit, make spacing and indentation consistent.
