\end{table}

In ExaHyPE compiled kernels preformed as expected, see Table \ref{tab:exahype}.
We observed a 5\%-15\% speedup in total program runtime, with programs limited by memory throughput.
The Euler 2D kernel improved the least at 5\% and the Euler 3D kernel the most at 15\%.
This is to be expected as values in the Euler 3D patch experience a slightly higher arithmetic intensity than those in 2D Euler, hence we can consider Euler 3D slightly less memory bound than Euler 2D.
