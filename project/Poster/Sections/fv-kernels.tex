A user begins by creating DAGs for the Problem Definition (i.e. flux, ncp, source terms, max eigen values functions).
A user then wraps these DAGs in builder functions (A function that when called returns a new version of their DAG).
These builder functions are then passed to a Rusanov and Patch Update builder functions, which are provided by the engine.
Patch Update and Runsaov use the users DAG numerous times, and create a new user DAG for every single use.

The final Patch Update DAG is passed to the FLAT compiler.
Here compiler transforms are preformed, and optional user transforms are preformed.
The final C++ output is typically 1000s to \textbf{10,000s of lines long}, and can be used as a direct replacement in an ExaHyPE project.
