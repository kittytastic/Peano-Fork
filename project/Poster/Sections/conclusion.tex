FLAT's simple approach to compilation allowed the conventional compiler (e.g. gcc) to better optimise kernels.
This lead to an order of magnitude speedup of compiled kernels over default kernels, while maintaining the modular construction of the kernels using engine and user code.
Within ExaHyPE we observed a 5\%-15\% speedup when using compiled kernels, limited by memory intensity of the test problems.
The results of this paper warrant further exploration of the FLAT compiler, and the development of tooling to make it easier to create DAGs for larger problems.
