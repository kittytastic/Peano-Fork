ExaHyPE (``An Exascale Hyperbolic PDE Engine'') is a software engine for solving systems of first-order hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs).
Hyperbolic PDEs can be used to describe many physical phenomena such as earthquakes, fluid dynamics and gravitational waves.
This paper explores applying a compiler based approach to generate fast compute kernels for a Finite Volume scheme, used to solve these PDEs within ExaHyPE.
Our compiler \phlat is used to generate Flat Long And potentially Transformed code.
Users describe their problem as a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph), where every node is a primitive operation, or a DAG itself.
This highly nested structure is then flattened and transformed into code; we target C++.
Generated kernels were typically thousands of lines long.
We found these kernels out preformed the kernels currently used within ExaHyPE by $9\times$ to $16\times$.
We explore why conventional compiles, such as \texttt{gcc}, can better optimise our compiled kernels, deducing that our compiled kernels can be better vectorized on SIMD architectures.
