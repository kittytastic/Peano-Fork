The ExaHyPE engine is very flexible, allowing users to model many different problems using a variety of numerical methods, while having to write very little code themselves.
To achieve this ExaHyPE generates a large amount code.
A majority of this code is highly optimised engine code that orchestrates solving the PDE over distributed systems.
The user only needs to provides a minimal amount of code that describes the problem e.g. source terms and fluxes.
This illudes to the inherent requirement for an interface between user and engine codes.

We will focus on this interface.
Namely, we will be looking at the patch update process.
This process dominates the time spent in user codes and often also dominates the total runtime of program.
Hence we are interested in evaluating and optimising this process.

The patch update process updates every cell in our domain.
Each cell is a vector of doubles that represents the state for a region of space in our FV scheme. 
A patch is a group of cells.
The size of a patch is specified by the user and will usually be in the region of 3x3 to 11x11 cells in 2D or 3x3x3 to 7x7x7 cells in 3D. % TODO fact check.
This process requires the ExaHyPE engine to interface with user codes on many occasions for each patch.
 
\newcommand{\func}[1]{\textbf{#1}}
\newcommand{\var}[1]{\textbf{#1}}

We can break patch update into 3 discrete steps.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \func{Patch update} - engine generated code
    \item  \func{Numerical method} - either engine generated or user code
    \item \func{Problem forumlation} - user code
\end{enumerate}

\func{Patch update} updates every cell in the patch by first considering source terms and then iter-cell flux.
This function takes multiple input arguments.
Firstly, it receives the current patch surrounded by halo of cells.
It also receives information about the patch, such as its spacial position and size.
Finally it receives lambda functions wrapping the \func{Numerical Methods} and \func{Problem formuation}. 
This function output the updated patch.  

\func{Numerical method} solves the Riemann problem at the shared face of 2 adjacent cells.
It takes as arguments: the 2 cells in question; information about cell size and position; and lambda functions wrapping the \func{Problem Forumlation}

\func{Problem Formulation} are a set of functions used to describe the problem in question e.g. the Euler equations.
These function calculate values of numerical flux, eigen values, source terms.

The flexible nature of ExaHyPE, along with its use of template driven code generation, experiences performance issues at the interface between the user and engine code.
Namely, engine code at this interface has to be general to accept a large range user codes, however this comes at the cost of performance.


Next we will take an indepth look at where there are potential inefficiencies within the Path Update process.
We will look at the 2D Euler equations and use the engine provided Rusanov numerical method.


\func{Patch update} starts by creating 2 variables \var{tmpA}, \var{tmpB} which are vectors an equal same size as a cell.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=c]
double * tmpA = ::tarch::allocateMemory(unknowns, tarch::MemoryLocation::Heap);
double * tmpB = ::tarch::allocateMemory(unknowns, tarch::MemoryLocation::Heap);
\end{lstlisting}

These variables are used to store the return values from calls to the source term function and \func{Numerical Method} steps.
To provide safe behaviour for any possible problem, these variables are allocated on the heap.
For many problems, including our example 2D Euler problem, cell sizes are small (e.g. 4 doubles), hence heap allocation is not required. 
This is our first definite inefficiency.
This issue also appears again in the Numerical method step which is used many times in \func{Patch update}.

The next step in \func{Patch update} iterates through every cell in the patch, applying the source term.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=c]
for(int i=0; i<patchSize; i++){
    for(int j=0; j<patchSize; j++){
        double * cellData = ...
        double cellCenterX = ...
        double cellCenterY = ...    
        sourceTerm(cellData, cellCenterX, cellCenterY, ..., tmpA);
        for(int k=0; k<unknowns; k++){
            outCell[...][k] = tmpA[k] * ...
        }
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}


We can observe that these loops are of fixed size, as the patchSize is known at compile time. 
Hence, they can be unrolled and values such as cellData can be precomputed.   
However, patchSize is an argument to patchUpdate and then patch update wrapped in a lambda function.
Therefore we run the risk of our compiler being unable to spot this optimisation.
We will label this a possible inefficiency.

This section of code also exhibits a recurring patten of function calls to lambda functions, receiving return values in one of our temporary variables.
In this case it is likely that the compiler will inline the code.
However proceeding calls to nested functions such as \func{Numerical Method} are much harder to inline, hence risk limiting the compilers ability to do SIMD operations.    
This is a second possible inefficiency.

After we process the source terms we update each cell by evaluating the flux between cell faces.
This also uses the double for loop patten in example (REF). %TODO
This step calls our numerical method on every pair on neighboring cells which we will call left and right.
In our example we use Rusanov as our numerical method.
In Rusanov we calculate the eigenvalues for the left cell and the right cell.
However, if we think about the traversal of cells e.g. [(0,0), (0,1)] [(0,1), (0,2)], .... First (0,1) will be a right cell, and then in the next call to Rusanov it will be the left cell, hence we calculate with eigenvalue for (0,1) twice, even though it hasn't changed.
This is our 2nd definite inefficiency.
This issue eludes to a set of definite inefficiencies where there are inter-process optimisation opportunities (e.g. patch update and numerical method can work together to avoid this double eigenvalue issue).   


Looking at the inefficiencies we identified we can see that they all stem from the general interface between user and engine code.
Given time, it is possible for a developer to manually fix these issues.
For example we took our example and fixed all issues excluding the double eigenvalue issue.
Doing this we observed a 3x speedup in the runtime of patch update, resulting in a 10\% speedup of the full program.

However these optimisation require a significant amount of manual work to preform, while risking both the introduction of errors and a reduction of readability/usability of users codes.

Therefore we propose creating a domain specific compiler that are make these optimisations automatically.
