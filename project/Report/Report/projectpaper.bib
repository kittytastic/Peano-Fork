abstract = {ExaHyPE (“An Exascale Hyperbolic PDE Engine”) is a software engine for solving systems of first-order hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs). Hyperbolic PDEs are typically derived from the conservation laws of physics and are useful in a wide range of application areas. Applications powered by ExaHyPE can be run on a student’s laptop, but are also able to exploit thousands of processor cores on state-of-the-art supercomputers. The engine is able to dynamically increase the accuracy of the simulation using adaptive mesh refinement where required. Due to the robustness and shock capturing abilities of ExaHyPE’s numerical methods, users of the engine can simulate linear and non-linear hyperbolic PDEs with very high accuracy. Users can tailor the engine to their particular PDE by specifying evolved quantities, fluxes, and source terms. A complete simulation code for a new hyperbolic PDE can often be realised within a few hours — a task that, traditionally, can take weeks, months, often years for researchers starting from scratch. In this paper, we showcase ExaHyPE’s workflow and capabilities through real-world scenarios from our two main application areas: seismology and astrophysics.
Program summary
Program title: ExaHyPE-Engine Program Files doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/6sz8h6hnpz.1 Licensing provisions: BSD 3-clause Programming languages: C++, Python, Fortran Nature of Problem: The ExaHyPE PDE engine offers robust algorithms to solve linear and non-linear hyperbolic systems of PDEs written in first order form. The systems may contain both conservative and non-conservative terms. Solution method: ExaHyPE employs the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method combined with explicit one-step ADER (arbitrary high-order derivative) time-stepping. An a-posteriori limiting approach is applied to the ADER-DG solution, whereby spurious solutions are discarded and recomputed with a robust, patch-based finite volume scheme. ExaHyPE uses dynamical adaptive mesh refinement to enhance the accuracy of the solution around shock waves, complex geometries, and interesting features.}

In this new approach we include space-variable coefficients to describe smooth or discontinuous material variations inside each element using the same numerical approximation strategy as for the velocity–stress variables in the formulation of the elastic wave equation. The combination of the DG method with a time integration scheme based on the solution of arbitrary accuracy derivatives Riemann problems still provides an explicit, one-step scheme which achieves arbitrary high-order accuracy in space and time. Compared to previous formulations the new scheme contains two additional terms in the form of volume integrals. We show that the increasing computational cost per element can be overcompensated due to the improved material representation inside each element as coarser meshes can be used which reduces the total number of elements and therefore computational time to reach a desired error level. We confirm the accuracy of the proposed scheme performing convergence tests and several numerical experiments considering smooth and highly heterogeneous material. As the approximation of the velocity and stress variables in the wave equation and of the material properties in the model can be chosen independently, we investigate the influence of the polynomial material representation on the accuracy of the synthetic seismograms with respect to computational cost. Moreover, we study the behaviour of the new method on strong material discontinuities, in the case where the mesh is not aligned with such a material interface. In this case second-order linear material approximation seems to be the best choice, with higher-order intra-cell approximation leading to potential instable behaviour. For all test cases we validate our solution against the well-established standard fourth-order finite difference and spectral element method.}",

The governing partial differential equations are solved via a new family of fully discrete and arbitrary high-order accurate path-conservative discontinuous Galerkin (DG) finite-element methods combined with adaptive mesh refinement and time accurate local time-stepping. In order to deal with shock waves and other discontinuities, the high-order DG schemes are supplemented with a novel a posteriori subcell finite-volume limiter, which makes the new algorithms as robust as classical second-order total-variation diminishing finite-volume methods at shocks and discontinuities, but also as accurate as unlimited high-order DG schemes in smooth regions of the flow. We show the advantages of this new approach by means of various classical two- and three-dimensional benchmark problems on fixed space–times. Finally, we present a performance and accuracy comparisons between Runge–Kutta DG schemes and ADER high-order finite-volume schemes, showing the higher efficiency of DG schemes.}",

abstract={We have developed a new, unified modeling technique for the total simulation of seismic waves, ocean acoustic waves, and tsunamis resulting from earthquakes, based on a finite difference method simulation of the 3D equations of motion. Using the equilibrium between the pressure gradient and gravity in these equations, tsunami propagation is naturally incorporated in the simulation based on the equations of motion. The performance of the parallel computation for the newly developed tsunami-coupled equations using a domain partitioning procedure shows a high efficiency coefficient with a large number of CPU cores. The simulation results show how the near-field term associated with seismic waves produced by shallow earthquakes leads to a permanent coseismic deformation of the ground surface, which gives rise to the initial tsunami on the sea surface. Propagation of the tsunami along the sea surface as a gravity wave, and ocean acoustic waves in seawater with high-frequency multiple P-wave reflections between the free surface and sea bottom, are also clearly demonstrated by the present simulations. We find a good agreement in the tsunami waveform between our results and those obtained by other simulations based on an analytical model and the Navier--Stokes equations, demonstrating the effectiveness of the tsunami-coupling simulation model. Based on this simulation, we show that the ratio of the amplitude of ocean acoustic waves to the height of the tsunami, both of which are produced by the earthquake, strongly depends on the rise time of the earthquake rupture. This ratio can be used to obtain a more detailed understanding of the source rupture processes of subduction zone earthquakes, and for implementing an improved tsunami alert system for slow tsunami earthquakes.},

Their performance optimization is indeed a challenging issue. Even though affine loop nests are generally present, the short trip counts and the complexity of mathematical expressions, which vary among different problems, make it hard to determine an optimal sequence of successful transformations. Our investigation has resulted in the implementation of a compiler (called COFFEE) for local assembly kernels, fully integrated with a framework for developing finite element methods. The compiler manipulates abstract syntax trees generated from a domain-specific language by introducing domain-aware optimizations for instruction-level parallelism and register locality. Eventually, it produces C code including vector SIMD intrinsics. Experiments using a range of real-world finite element problems of increasing complexity show that significant performance improvement is achieved. The generality of the approach and the applicability of the proposed code transformations to other domains is also discussed.},

Our particular focus is on providing a performance portable solution for heterogeneous distributed multi-GPU systems. We therefore redesigned SeisSol’s code generation cascade for GPU programming models. This includes CUDA source code generation for the performance-critical small batched matrix multiplications kernels. The parallelisation extends the existing MPI+X scheme and supports SeisSol’s cluster-wise Local Time Stepping (LTS) algorithm for ADER time integration. We performed a Roofline model analysis to ensure that the generated batched matrix operations achieve the performance limits posed by the memory-bandwidth roofline. Our results also demonstrate that the generated GPU kernels outperform the corresponding cuBLAS subroutines by 2.5 times on average. We present strong and weak scaling studies of our implementation on the Marconi100 supercomputer (with 4 Nvidia Volta V100 GPUs per node) on up to 256 GPUs , which revealed good parallel performance and efficiency in case of time integration using global time stepping. However, we show that directly mapping the LTS method from CPUs to distributed GPU environments results in lower hardware utilization. Nevertheless, due to the algorithmic advantages of local time stepping, the method still reduces time-to-solution by a factor of 1.3 on average in contrast to the GTS scheme.},

abstract = {Modern compilers implement a large number of optimizations which all interact in complex ways, and which all have a different impact on code quality, compilation time, code size, energy consumption, etc. For this reason, compilers typically provide a limited number of standard optimization levels, such as -O1, -O2, -O3 and -Os, that combine various optimizations providing a number of trade-offs between multiple objective functions (such as code quality, compilation time and code size). The construction of these optimization levels, i.e., choosing which optimizations to activate at each level, is a manual process typically done using high-level heuristics based on the compiler developer's experience.This paper proposes COLE, Compiler Optimization Level Exploration, a framework for automatically finding Pareto optimal optimization levels through multi-objective evolutionary searching. Our experimental results using GCC and the SPEC CPU benchmarks show that the automatic construction of optimization levels is feasible in practice, and in addition, yields better optimization levels than GCC's manually derived (-Os, -O1, -O2 and -O3) optimization levels, as well as the optimization levels obtained through random sampling. We also demonstrate that COLE can be used to gain insight into the effectiveness of compiler optimizations as well as to better understand a benchmark's sensitivity to compiler optimizations.},
