 * The aggregation boundary data exchanger is usually only used for integers
 * and chars. It does not send out data step by step but collects all data in
 * one big buffer and sends it out at the end of the sweep. This way, we
 * eliminate the option for Peano to transfer data in the background. However,
 * we also eliminate any overhead created by lots of small messages.
 *
 * As we rely a lot on quite manual data modifications, this particular data
 * exchanger works only with the specialised heaps such as the CharHeap and the
 * DoubleHeap.
 *
 * <h2> Internal data format </h2>
 *
 * The very first entry in the array sent out is the number of (encoded)
 * messages. Per message we then have one entry which describes the number of
 * entries for this message, and then the actual message data.
