     * Switches receive and deploy buffer between two iterations.
     *
     * This method switches receive and deploy buffer for heap data
     * exchanged between neighbours. This happens between two iterations
     * in which heap data is exchanged and results in a situation where
     * the former receive buffer is the deploy buffer afterwards and vice
     * versa.
     *
     * Due to the polling mechanism in receiveDanglingMessages(...) it
     * might happen that the receive buffer before the switch contains
     * messages which belong to the following iteration, since a
     * neighbouring rank may already be an iteration ahead. These
     * messages need to reside in the new receive buffer (i.e. the
     * former deploy buffer). Thus, after switching both buffers the
     * information of the statistics map is used to copy all messages
     * that do not belong to the previous iteration to the new receive
     * buffer.
     *
     * <h2> Realisation </h2>
     *
     * We assume that all message in the receive buffer are already unpacked/in
     * a state that we can directly extract them from the receive buffer. If
     * you use sophisticated packing/coding mechanisms, all data in the receive
     * buffer is assumed to be uncompressed. See receiveDanglingMessages() for
     * details. This operation is really based upon the actual value of the
     * field _receiveTasks[1-_currentReceiveBuffer].size().
     *
     * <h2> Overtaking messages </h2>
     *
     * If Peano manages to break tight synchronisation, i.e. to run multiple
     * sweeps of different traversals in parallel, it can happen that messages
     * arrive in the buffer that belong to already the subsequent traversal.
     * These may not be delivered in the current traversal, i.e. we may switch
     * the buffers, but then we have to return those additional messages to the
     * receive buffer again.
     *
     * releaseReceivedNeighbourMessagesRequests() is called directly before we
     * switch and we are not allowed to receive any dangling stuff in-between.
     * We therefore may copy around message meta data - we are sure that we do
     * not move around MPI handles in memory where MPI still might alter stuff.
     *

     * @param numberOfMessagesSentThisIteration The switch mechanism has to be
     *   know how many data have to be in the new receive buffer. If there are

     *
     * <h2> Behaviour </h2>
     *
     * This operation consists of two parts. It allows the MPI engine to
     * progress and it looks out whether there are new messages arriving.
     *
     * <h3> Progress </h3>
     *
     * While MPI messages with the heap's tag are in the MPI queue (we check
     * through an iprobe on the meta data tag), the routine receives the meta
     * data. We work on the meta data as the heap can also be used to send out
     * zero data. In this case, no real data but only meta data might be
     * exchanged.
     *
     * It is important to receive the meta data with the sleep argument -1.
     * This way, Peano uses blocking MPI. Otherwise, the code would use a
     * non-blocking receive and invoke receiveDanglingMessages() until the
     * receive terminates. This would lead indirectly to recursive calls to
     * this operation and thus might mess up the receive order. Once the meta
     * data is in, we invoke handleAndQueueReceivedTask().
     *
     * The handleAndQueueReceivedTaks() routine has to enqueue the received
     * task immediately into _receiveTasks. Some additional steps then might
     * become necessary, before triggerReceive() on the task object is invoked.
     * No matter what exactly is done, you may not issue any routine that might
     * indirectly invoke receiveDanglingMessages() before the actual MPI
     * receive. Notably, you may not use Peano's/DaStGen's receive and send
     * operations which map logically blocking routines on their non-blocking
     * variants with busy polling.
     *
     * <h3> Progress </h3>
     *
     * Most MPI implementations cannot exchange data really  in the background.
     * They only do so if we call MPI_Test from time to time.
     *
     * <h3> Call points </h3>
     *
     * This operation is either called by any send or receive in Peano that is
     * logically blocking but does not return, or it is invoked through
     * waitUntilNumberOfReceivedNeighbourMessagesEqualsNumberOfSentMessages()
     * or releaseSentMessages() at the begin/end of a traversal.
     *
     * <h3> Background tasks </h3>
     *
     * While we do receive, we have to switch of the background tasks. Once we
     * are done, we should enable them if they had been enabled before. The
     * routine also is used in some release data phases where the background
     * tasks are suspended anyway. So we may not always switch background tasks
     * on again. We have to memorize the value and then restore this one. If we
     * are called by the background tasks, the whole thing is already protected
     * by a mutex (we ensure that noone changes the task's state while we get
     * in MPI data). So we may not switch ourself - this would otherwise
     * introduce a deadlock.
