/**
 * A specialised version of the boundary data exchanger assuming absolute
 * symmetry of the data exchanges
 *
 * The class fuses ideas of the RLEBoundaryDataExchanger and a class proposed
 * by Dominic Charrier called NonBlockingExchanger. Its fundamental assumption
 * is that
 *
 * All data exchange is totally symmetric, i.e. if rank a sends a message of
 * size k for one vertex to rank b, then rank b sends also a message of size
 * k to a.
 *
 * That having said, we can simplify/skip some data communication:
 *
 * - We count the number of empty messages in-between two sends with data. The
 *   very moment the second send is triggered, we know that there would also be
 *   the same number of empty messages from the neighbour side and we insert
 *   those guys into the receiver queue. See handleEmptyMessagesInBetweenTwoRealSends().
 * - Whenever handleAndQueueSendTask() is called, we don't send out any meta
 *   data. As everything is symmetric, the neighbour already knows that some
 *   data is dropping in. That implies, we should immediately queue a receive
 *   task for the respective data.
 *
 * @see RLEBoundaryDataExchanger
