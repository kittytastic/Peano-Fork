     *
     * There is a rather naive interpretation of geometric information:
     *
     * - If a point plus its h environment is inside, then the vertex is
     *   inside.
     * - If a point is outside the closure of the computational domain,
     *   then this point is outside.
     * - Otherwise, the point is a boundary point and we can coarsen it.
     *
     * <h3> Hidden Geometries </h3>
     *
     * Unfortunately, this is working this way. In principle, we should
     * always coarsen outer vertices. However, if a vertex is outside and
     * all cell-connected neighbours are outside, too, it can happen that
     * we don't see inclusions.
     *
     * Besides the geometry update, we also have to check whether the
     * computationally is hidden in the cell: This happens if all the vertices
     * adjacent to a cell are outside but the domain is contained within the
     * cell.
     *

     *
     * I would like to do all the artificial boundary refinement here, but this is
     * not possible. To run the analysis, I have to know whether cell-connected
     * vertices are refined. However, the present routine has only geometric data.
     * As a consequence, you find this artificial refinement in Node::updateCellsGeometryInformationAfterLoad().
