/**
 * Simple d-dimensional For-Loop
 *
 * This class is a simple wrapper for for-loops that has one significant
 * advantage: It is parallelised if TBBs or OpenMP are included. The class
 * needs, besides the range (iteration space), an event handle (loop body) with
 * implements $void operator() (const tarch::la::Vector<DIMENSIONS,int>& i)$.
 * This means you write a simple class with a constructor and this one
 * operation. Then, you move the body of your original for-loop to the
 * implementation of the operator() and replace the original for loop by
 * something similar to
 * \code
  typedef loops::GridStoreVertexLoopBody LoopBody;
  LoopBody loopBody(*this,other arguments you need within the loop body);
  peano::datatraversal::dForLoop<LoopBody>(int-vector with loop range,loopBody);
\endcode
 *
 * The range implementation will copy the loop body for each thread, i.e. you
 * have to ensure that there is an appropriate copy constructor for your loop
 * body. The loop body class itself may have a state and also may modify this
 * state from call to call. However, this state ain't persistent, i.e. after
 * the very last iteration (and you actually don't know how many iterations
 * there will be due to load stealing), the complete object is thrown away.
 *
 * If you want to merge a thread's local copies into a global variable, you can
 * do this in the destructor. The grid's loops for example all have a
 * destructor that first locks a global semaphore, and then it calls a merge
 * operation on the mappings.
 *
 * !!! Parallel Implementation (TBB)
 *
 * The TBB implementation is straightforward. While I could deploy the range
 * management to the loop bodys, i.e. the loop bodys' operator() runs over a
 * whole range, this would make the implementation more difficult. Instead, I
 * decided to require the loop body only to provide an operator() operating on
 * one single element.
 *
 * However, forcing TBB to create a task per loop element in turn induces a big
 * overhead. Thus, I introduced an intermediate layer: The embedded class
 * dForLoopInstance implements the loop over a (sub)-range, i.e. the dForLoop
 * itself just creates an instance of dForLoopInstance and invokes a parallel
 * for for this object. The object accepts a Peano range, traverses this range,
 * and invokes the loop body's operator() for each range element. It is
 * important that dForLoopInstance creates a thread-local copy of the loop body
 * - Peano allows loop bodys to have a (thread-wise) state. Thus, we have to
 * ensure that we are working on a copy and that not all threads are working on
 * the same loop body instance.
 *
 * One may not use TBB's parallel_for as parallel for requires the loop bodies
 * to be const. Instead, we have to use the parallel_reduce even though we
 * merge the copies ourself in the destructors.
 *
 * !!! Cobra/C++11
 *
 * For Cobra, we could in theory use parallel_for, as Cobra's parallel for
 * supports non-const loop handles. However, I encountered some compiler
 * errors (see http://software.intel.com/en-us/forums/topic/293787) and
 * incompatible range signatures (Cobra has another range signature than
 * TBB), so I realise the parallel for as bipartitioning myself in a function
 * of its own.
 *
 * !!! Copy Policies
 *
 * If the code is running serial, the loop body is not copied at all. If the
 * code runs in parallel, each thread creates a copy of the loop body. In
 * particular, also the master thread first creates a copy and then loops,
 * i.e. we also create a copy even if we work only with one thread.
