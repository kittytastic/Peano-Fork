/**
 * Peano Patch File Format
 *
 * The Peano patch file format is simplistic: It basically dumps each individual
 * patch into the file without any adjacency or whatever. By default, each Peano
 * block file consist at least of two pieces of data: An actual data file and a
 * meta data file. The file format does not really distinguish them, as any file
 * can include another one. But the meta file is the file you specify when you
 * create the data plotter. The idea here is that you call this create once with
 * a true (the old file then is deleted) and from here with false, so further
 * snapshots are appended.
 *
 *
 * <h2> Time-dependent data </h2>
 *
 * <h2> Parallel (MPI) runs </h2>

     * to the unit square/cube.
     *
     * A mapping runs over all vertices and gives per vertex the two or three,
     * respective, coordinates of the vertex relative to the unit cube.
