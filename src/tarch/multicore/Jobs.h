        * Tell job system that pending background tasks and highy priority tasks now should be done asap
        *
        * All of the discussion below highlights the usage pattern. In
        * practice, it is very convenient to invoke startToProcessBackgroundJobs()
        * in endIteration(), i.e. once you know all `hard' stuff is done.
        * This implies that the exchange of MPI data teams up with background
        * job processing. The snippets below abstract from this fact.
        *
        * <h2> Usage pattern A: wait for all background jobs prior to subsequent traversal</h2>
        *
        * Some codes want to wait until all background jobs have terminated
        * before they issue a new traversal. IF the background jobs restrict
        * some global variable, e.g., there's kind of a synchronisation point
        * where we have to stop.  In this case, the program snippets typically
        * look similar to
        *
        * <pre>
          while (!tarch::multicore::jobs::finishToProcessBackgroundJobs()) {
            tarch::parallel::Node::getInstance().receiveDanglingMessages();
          }
          </pre>
        *
        * This example illustrates that you can invoke finishToProcessBackgroundJobs()
        * without a corresponding start invocation. However, I consider it to
        * be good practice to issue start explicitly. So you'd have:
        *
        * <pre>
          tarch::multicore::jobs::startToProcessBackgroundJobs();
          while (!tarch::multicore::jobs::finishToProcessBackgroundJobs()) {
            tarch::parallel::Node::getInstance().receiveDanglingMessages();
          }
          </pre>
        *
        *
        * <h2> Usage pattern B: wait for particular background or high priority job </h2>
        *
        * Some codes wanna wait for particular background jobs only. In this
        * case, see the example below on hybrid runs how to realise this.
        *
        * The example would also work without a start invocation. However,
        * I consider it to be good practice to issue start explicitly. This is
        * then done prior to the while loop.
        *
        * Some hybrid codes use processBackgroundJobs at certain points as they
        * have to wait for some low priority stuff to terminate. Such a method
        * invocation then often is embedded into a while loop. If you do this,
        * please ensure you receive dangling messages, i.e. that your while
        * loop looks similar to
        *
        * <pre>
bool terminate = false;
tarch::multicore::jobs::startToProcessBackgroundJobs();
while ( !terminate ) {
  tarch::parallel::Node::getInstance().receiveDanglingMessages();
  terminate = data I'm waiting for is available;
}
tarch::multicore::jobs::finishToProcessBackgroundJobs();
        </pre>
        *
        * Please note that it is convenient to remove/comment out the
        * finishToProcessBackgroundJobs() here: you know that you have the data
        * you are waiting for, so why bother with some cleanup/finish calls.
        *
        * <h2> Number of background jobs </h2>
        *
        * Most shared memory implementations in Peano do constrain the maximum
        * number of background jobs. If all threads do background jobs at a
        * time, one hardly can speak of a background job anymore. Once such
        * jobs however enter a phase where they wait (for MPI, e.g.), it makes
        * sense to weaken this constraint. Then, it is not a problem anymore if
        * (almost) all cores do process the background jobs. If you call
        * startToProcessBackgroundJobs(), then this tells the runtime system
        * that background jobs and high priority jobs from hereon shall have a high prioriy.
