         * There are basically the following modes: _MM_HINT_T0,
         * _MM_HINT_T1, _MM_HINT_T2 and _MM_HINT_NTA. T0 means a
         * prefetch into all cache levels. T1 means into all levels
         * except L1 (L1 might be populated but we do not enforce it),
         * T2 means at least L3. NTA is the most defensive one.
         * It loads stuff as close to the core as possible without
         * polluting any other caches.
         *
         * We usually use mode/hint _MM_HINT_NTA for data on machines with
         * Optane. This makes the data be loaded into L3. For urgent
         * computations it might however make sense to use T0.
