  /**
   * Derive Element-wise Matrices From Stencils
   *
   * Many components in the Peano framework switch from a stencil notation to
   * element-wise assembly matrices frequently. As both representations (stencils
   * and element-wise matrices) are equivalent, it is reasonable to code only one
   * representation, and to derive the alternative representation automatically.
   * This class provides the required operation.
   *
   * - Stencils are stored within vertices (red lines for a 5-point stencil in
   *   2d, e.g.).
   * - However, sometimes we don't have access to neighbouring cells (big blue
   *   cell, e.g., is one coarse cell where the solver automaton descends to
   *   finer grids)
   * - Consequently, we have to convert the @f$ 2^d @f$ vertex stencils within
   *   each cell into a element-wise assembly matrix @f$ \mathbf{R}^{2^d \times 2^d}@f$.
   *   With this matrix, we then can accumulate the residuals.
   * - PeProt automatically generates a routine that takes the @f$ 2^d @f$
   *   vertices and writes their @f$ 3^d @f$ stencils into one big vector of
   *   length @f$ 2^d \cdot 3^d @f$.
   * - This class provides a routine that transforms this big vector into an
   *   element assembly matrix.
   * - There's also a shortcut operaration that takes only one stencil. In this
   *   case, we assume that the stencil is the same for all @f$ 2^d @f$ adjacent
   *   vertices of the cell.
   *
   * <h1> Example </h1>
   *
   * We have the stencil
   *
   * @f$ \left[ \begin{array}{ccc} -1 & -1 & -1 \\ -1 & 8 & -1 \\ -1 & -1 & -1 \end{array} \right] @f$
   *
   * for (d=2). It is stored as a vector of length nine. Within a cell, we have
   * four vertices. The values u of these vertices can be converted into one
   * vector of length four due to a call of the  operation
   * \code
  tarch::la::Vector<TWO_POWER_D,double> u = MyVertices::readU(...);
   \endcode
   * Such a  operation is generated, if you add the statement
   * \code
    read scalar: U
   \endcode
   * to your Peano specification file. Now, if you wanna compute matrix times
   * vector, you basically compute $Au$ with A being a @f$ 4 \times 4 @f$
   * matrix. A is well-defined by the stencil. In this example, it would be
   *
   * @f$ \left[ \begin{array}{cccc} 2 & -0.5 & -0.5 & -1.0 \\ -0.5 & 2 & -1.0 & -0.5 \\ -0.5 & -1.0 & 2 & -0.5 \\ -1.0 & -0.5 & -0.5 & 2 \end{array} \right] @f$
   *
   * The  methods of this class convert your stencil into the element-wise
   * stiffness matrix. There's two variants of conversion operations:
   *
   * - The simple variant takes one stencil and creates the stiffness matrix. It
   *   resembles the example.
   * - A more flexible variant takes @f$ 2^d @f$ stencils and creates the
   *   element-wise system matrix. This is the method of choice if you have
   *   different stencils on the different vertices.
