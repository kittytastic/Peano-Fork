     * If codes use getElementWiseAssemblyMatrix() within cells, this operation
     * decomposes stencils assuming that all @f$ 2^d @f$ adjacent cells are
     * visited. For interior degrees of freedom this works fine. See the top
     * row in the cartoon below.

     * It does not hold if we are near to the boundary. See second row left.
     * The six-point stencil corresponds to a homogeneous Neumann condition and
     * shows the stencil that has to be evaluated if the boundary holds a real
     * degree of freedom.
     *
     * If we use getElementWiseAssemblyMatrix(), this stencil is decomposed
     * according to the middle right illustration. It yields the wrong result
     * as there are only cells visited. We could provide specialised versions
     * of getElementWiseAssemblyMatrix() that are evaluated at the boundary.
     * However, it is often more convenient to treat all cells exactly the same
     * way but to modify the stencil entries (red, bottom left) such that
     * getElementWiseAssemblyMatrix() yields the right evaluation in the end.
     *
     * This is exactly the job of this preprocessing routine that accepts the
     * 'real' stencil (top left) plus a bitfield describing whether a boundary
     * runs vertically through the degree domain, e.g. (first entry in
     * boundaryFaceNormals is set as the normal is parallel to the first axis).
     * The routine then upscales the stencil entries such that an evaluation in
     * the end yields the right result.
     *
     * @param boundaryFaceNormals Where is the boundary. The first Dimensions
     *        entry refer to the faces running through the left bottom vertex.

      *
      * <h1>Realisation</h1>
      *
      * The realisation is very simple and relies on a central finite
      * difference discretisation. This is the discretisation corresponding to
      * d-linear finite elements. We explain the discretisation at hands of a
      * 2d setup for a vertex that is at the right boundary of the domain. The
      * stencil is given by
      * <pre>
s6  s7  s8       -1   -1   -1
s3  s4  s5   =   -1    8   -1
s0  s1  s2       -1   -1   -1
        </pre>
      *
      * We (virtually) extend the domain by one layer and obtain an additional
      * virtual degree of freedom right of the boundary. Let's denote all the
      * unknowns accessed by the stencil as
      * <pre>
u6  u7  u8
u3  u4  u5
u0  u1  u2
        </pre>
      * Obviously, u2,u5 and u8 are not defined. However, we now apply the
      * Neumann conditions with the rules:
      *
        u2   =  h(0)*derivative + u0
        u5   =  h(0)*derivative + u3
        u8   =  h(0)*derivative + u6
      *
      * We see that the residual evaluation results from an evaluation of the
      * u0,u1,u3,u4,u6,u7 terms plus an additional term
      *
      * h(0)*derivative*(s2+s5+s8) + s2*u0 + s5*u3 + s8*u6
      *
      * This is what the routine does: it modifies the stencil (here
      * s0 \mapsto s0+s2, s3 \mapsto s3+s5 and s6 \mapsto s6+s8) and returns
      * the modified rhs.

      * @param derivative Pass zero if you have homogeneous Neumann
