   * complicated settings as well. 
   *
   * There is no application reason to make this state parallelise, but we are 
   * moving around particles due to its constructors several times and these 
   * constructors check all fields for valid values. If we receive something 
   * not marked as parallelise, we either have to initialise it prior to moving 
   * or we get garbage. Initialising is tricky, so I just communicate this stuff.
