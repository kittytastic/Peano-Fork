/**
 * Task Set
 *
 * This is my very simple wrapper of task parallelism in Peano. The class
 * provides only one type of constructor. This constructor is passed a set of
 * tasks. The constructor executes all of them in parallel (if this is the
 * user's wish) and returns. Consequently, this wrapper is the right choice iff
 * all the task are totally independent of each other.
 *
 * The standard variants do not copy the task you hand in and I expect the
 * functors to be handed in as references.
 *
 * <h2> Task priorities </h2>
 *
 * Tasks in Peano can have different priorities. Within the Peano core code, I
 * don't use these priorities, but work with logical names (task types). One
 * further job of this wrapper thus is to map the logical task types onto
 * numerical priorities.
 *
 * <h2> Autotuning </h2>
 *
 * Finally, the class expects an identifier that allows this wrapper to
 * autotune. Autotuning in the present context always means `should I invoke
 * some operation as task or rather do stuff sequentially'.

     *
     * <h2> LIFO </h2>
     *
     * My LIFO implementation is really simplistic: I use an internal counter
     * which I increment after each spawn. This way, the later a task spawn
     * the higher the task's priority. The counter is not thread-safe, but
     * that doesn't matter as priorities are only recommendations for the
     * runtime anyway.
     *
     * My priorities cover fixed ranges that we split up into high priority vs
     * low priority areas. So we have to reset the priorities/LIFO counter
     * every now and then to ensure that it does not overflow. I do this by
     * checking against the total number of jobs. If this total number is
     * low, I reset the counter. I originally wanted to reset when it is
     * zero, but that means that I can't handle persistent jobs: If one user
     * uses a persistent job that reschedules itself over and over again, the
     * tasking would never reset the priority counter. So I use 32. This can
     * accommodate a relatively high number of persistent tasks.
