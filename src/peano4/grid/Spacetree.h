     * pushback container and an LR(k) lookup.
     *
     * - Every leaf pushes a marker into this container: _id if it is and

     *   otherwise.
     * - A refined cell induces a reduce on the container. @f$ 3^d@f$ markers
     *   are removed and analysed: If they all have the same ip as the next
     *   split marker to be used, we add it.
     *
     * - A refined cell finally adds its marker again.
     *
     * It is important that I evaluate the reduce analysis even if no splits
     * are do be done anymore. Because it might happen that I have just done
     * exactly 9 splits for example (2d) and thus, the parent of these 9

     * If we now simply copied the adjacency list from B, we'd loose the

     * <h2> Computational domain </h2>
     *
     * Some of the steps of this routine have to be done totally agnostic of
     * whether the vertex is inside the domain or not. The coarsening for
     * example has to be done outside of the domain as well.
     *
     * For the post-refinement, we also have to take into account outer
     * vertices. A vertex is to be refined, if it is unrefined and surrounded
     * by $2^d$ refined cells. In this case, it still technically is a hanging
     * vertex which should be avoided. This notably can happen outside.
     *
     *
     * <h2> Restriction of veto flags </h2>
     *
     * We make each vertex hold a flag isAntecessorOfRefinedVertex. If it is
     * set, we veto any erasing here. This way, we can ensure that the trees
     * remove at most one level at a time. We illustrate all further
     * explanations with a simple example:
     *
     * @image html Spacetree_updateVertexBeforeStore_restrictIsAntecessorOfRefinedVertex.png
     *
     * Let the red vertices be refined. In a serial code, the tree is not
     * split. You have to glue together the left and right tree. As the middle
     * level's vertex holds the refinement flag, the top level vertex carries
     * the flag isAntecessorOfRefinedVertex. It consequently never is erased.
     * Users first have to remove the finer level.
     *
     * If we split up tree into two threads, this approach fails if the flag
     * is restricted per core in the bottom-up steps. By the end of the sweep,
     * the flag is set on the right tree, but it is not set on the left tree.
     * We consequently might decide to erase on the left tree but veto this on
     * the right tree.
     *
     * To eliminate this behaviour, we split up the flag into a current flag
     * and a flag from the previous solution. This flag is rolled over. If the
     * flag is set, it undoes any erase trigger.
     *
     * <h2> Clean-up of vertices </h2>
     *
     * I originally had the following idea:
     *
     * If a vertex is remote, we manually clear all of its adjacency flags.
     * This is a security thing. It might happen that such a vertex refers to
     * a tree x and that this index x is later re-used (for a new local subtree
     * for example). In this case, a left-over index might suddenly suggest that
     * a totally irrelevant vertex is adjacent to the newish x tree.
     *
     * However, this is wrong in some cases: We have to keep our adjacency.
     * Because if we merge later on, we rely on this adjacency to find out
     * which vertices we have to join.
     *
     * So we have to run for the middle way: We erase all adjacency data but
     * if ad only if a vertex is not adjacent to any kid.
     *

     *   splitting phase, we have to receive data from the tree that is

     * - Exchange vertices along domain boundary.
     * - Send/stream data to another rank which is just splitting (see item

     *

     *
     *
     * <h2> Boundary data exchange </h2>
     *
     * For a local vertex, i.e. one adjacent to the current active tree, which
     * is neighbouring another tree, we do receive this tree's data copy and
     * then merge it into the local tree.
     *
     * This approach doesn't work straightforwardly when we split: Lets assume
     * tree 0 is triggered to split into 0 and 1. In a first step, tree 0 enters
     * the state split triggered. It now updates all adjacency lists, so
     * boundary data is already sent out to 1 - even though 1 is not instantiated
     * yet. Once we are done, we copy over (parts of) tree 0 into tree 1, so
     * tree 1 now does exist and is well-prepared to receive the data already
     * dropped by 0. This second step is the actual splitting step. Now, other
     * ranks have still sent in data to 0 which actually should go to 1. We
     * receive those guys, but we have to eliminate explicitly any incoming data
     * we'd expect from 1 as 1 didn't have the chance yet to send it out.
     *
     * The function is called directly
     * after a vertex has been read from the input stream. Please note that
     * an update of the refinement states (e.g. switch from
     * refinement-triggered to refining) happens after the merge. Any update of the
     * refinement state in this operation hence immediately affects the
     * vertex updates in this very iteration.
     *
     * The update of the adjacency information is simple: If a neighbour tells us
     * that it has changed an adjacency entry in one of its own fields, i.e. if
     * it has changed its own entry, we copy this information over. Otherwise, we
     * ignore any updates (there should not be any).
