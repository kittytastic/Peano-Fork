	 * we need two stacks. The first one is for data flow along the coordinate
	 * axis, the other one for the flow in the opposite direction. We order the
	 * set of stacks this way: first all the ones along, then those in the other
	 * direction. The whole thing becomes more complicated once we allow periodic
	 * boundary conditions along multiple axis. In this case, we have those stacks
	 * realising face-to-face wraps, but we also have to support combinations for
	 * the few vertices which go diagonal within the cube. So we have 2d face
	 * stacks but then any additional 2 out of 2d and and 3 out of 2d combination
	 * which is to be supported, too.
	 *
	 * The whole set of stacks is replicated: We need a set of these stacks to
	 * read from (those are the lower ones). They are followed by stacks to write
	 * to. The two stacks are swapped over after each iteration. Within each set,
	 * we first have all the stacks for data flow along the axis and then those
	 * the other way round. For these, read access has to be permuted, too. This
	 * is realised within getPeriodicBoundaryExchangeInputStackNumberForOutputStack().
	 *
	 * So for any vertex, we have a bitset with 2*Dimensions entries which tells
	 * us exactly which data flows are tied to this vertex. Not all populations
	 * of this bitset are admissible - you can't have the flag 'along x axis'
	 * combined with 'against x axis' - but the highest d bits could be set.
