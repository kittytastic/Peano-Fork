/**
 * Encapsulates Smoothness-based Refinement and Coarsening
 *
 * This class is not abstract, but it should not be used directly. Use a subclass instead.
 *
 *
 * <h2> Usage </h2>
 *
 * To use this class, you have to do the following operations:
 *
 * - Add your dof/vertex a double vector of size dimensions:
 *   <pre>
  discard parallelise double linearSurplus[DIMENSIONS];
     </pre>
 *   This attribute typically is a discard attribute. Alternatively, you can
 *   use a scalar. The vector version is more accurate, as it is able to
 *   detect saddle points. The scalar version however works as good in most
 *   cases.
 *
 * - You need the following operations on your vertex that are to be specified
 *   in the specification file:
 *   <pre>
     read vector(double): linearSurplus
     read vector(double): solution
     write vector(double): linearSurplus
     </pre>
 *
 *    Please adopt the term solution accordingly. If you decide to work with
 *    scalars only, exchange the vectors by scalars.
 *
 * - Make your PDE-solver/mapping hold an instance of matrixfree::solver::LinearSurplusRefinementCriterion.
 *
 * - Augment your mapping accordingly:
 *   - Constructor: Make it pass the instance of
 *     LinearSurplusRefinementCriterion reasonable values (you might also
 *     decide to plug in meaningless values for the time being and then reset
 *     those values later in beginIteration()). Please note that there are two
 *     subtypes of this class. You have to choose one of them.
 *   - beginIteration(): invoke clearMeasurements(). The operation might
 *     require an argument. Check the documentation of the subclass you have
 *     chosen.
 *   - touchVertexFirstTime(): clear the surplus values of your vertex. If you
 *     include VertexOperations.h, you may call
 *     <pre>
 *       VertexOperations::writeLinearSurplus(fineGridVertex,0.0);
 *     </pre>
 *   - enterCell(): invoke getNewLinearSurplus(). See the method's
 *     documentation for more details how to invoke the operation.
 *   - touchVertexLastTime(): invoke analyse() and
 *     getNewLinearSurplusContributionFromFineGrid(). See code snippet below
 *     for a typical usage pattern.
 *
 *  Please ensure that you do the analysis only for inner points. The linear
 *  surplus is invalid for boundary vertices.
 *
 *
 * <h2> Remarks on the refinement criterion </h2>
 *
 * touchVertexLastTime() invokes analyse to identify whether a vertex is to be
 * refined/coarsened or not. This is only a textbook guideline. In practice, it
 * does make sense to make the refinement decision anticipate
 * application-specific knowledge:
 *
 * - If the problem is elliptic, it usually makes sense to implement
 *   the Delete action as well. It often happens that one overestimates/wants to
 *   overestimate the refinement or that a regular refinement speeds up the
 *   convergence (either due to the vectorisation or mg speed) but then has to
 *   coarse the solution to reduce the memory footprint.
 * - If a part of the grid has not converged, it usually does not make sense to
 *   refine it further: Too high is the risk that the final solution is smooth
 *   and does not require further refinement (see notes on oscillations). I thus
 *   recommend to have an additional check within the Refine branch that takes
 *   the residual into account. Please be aware that the residual does not give
 *   any clue how big the change in the solution actually is, i.e. it usually
 *   gives better results to divide the residual by the diagonal element.
 *   Please do not the residual analysis around the overall refinement
 *   evaluation. analyse() has to be called always. Otherwise, the criterion has
 *   no idea of the overall surplus distribution.
 * - If you are interested in a smooth grid an a global energy minimisation, it
 *   also makes sense to penalty too deep refinements. In this case, I recommend
 *   to scale the refinement criterion with the volume of fineGridH. In most
 *   cases however this scaling has no severe impact.
 *
 * A typical snippet for an elliptic code then is given below.

 *
 * <h2> Oscillations with MLAT-type algorithms </h2>
 *
 * For partially overlapping domain decomposition approaches (MLAT, e.g.) in
 * combination with Jacobi or other single-level solvers, we observe that the
 * refinement criterion often introduces dents in the solution. The explanation
 * is straightforward: The solver is in O(n^2), i.e. the finer the grid the slower
 * convergence. If we introduce a transition from h into h/3, the finer part in
 * the next sweep will converge slower than the coarser part. If the solution
 * has not converged before reasonably, the faster part will move towards the
 * solution faster than the slower part. For an inhomogeneous rhs, this means
 * that it somehow overtakes the fine resolution area. This is the reason for a
 * dent seen.
 *
 * This is a solver-inherent problem. There are some ways to deal with it if
 * you want to (it is actually not wrong, so there is no urgent need to fix
 * this dent):
 *
 * - Use a higher order interpolation scheme when refining or apply few
 *   smoothing steps on added vertices prior to continuing. The latter picks up
 *   the smoothed aggregation idea. This does not completely solve the issue
 *   (it is still a solver-inherent think), but it smoothes out the dent
 *   slightly.
 * - Use a multigrid solver. This one is in O(n) and thus should not run into
 *   these problems.
 * - Do not refine before the solution has not converged globally. In this
 *   case, the dents cannot pop up as well.
 *
 * <h2> Complex-valued PDEs </h2>
 *
 * This class should also work for complex-valued PDEs.
 *
 * <h2> inf values on vertices (also important for plotting) and 3:1 balancing </h2>
 *
 * The refinement criterion ensures that it never erases more than one level.
 * For this, it does a very simple trick: Usually, getLinearSurplusContributionFromFineGrid()
 * restricts doubles/complex numbers from the fine grid to the next coarser
 * grid (cmp to blue arrow in illustration below).
 *
 * @image html LinearSurplusRefinementCriterion.png
 *
 * In the sketch above, vertices marked with a green circle are refined. The
 * vertex marked with a blue one is unrefined.
 *
 * If a vertex value from a refined vertex shall be restricted (red arrow), we
 * set the linear surplus on the parent vertex to infinity. This in turn means
 * that adjacent vertices on the coarse level might become infinity as well
 * (blue arrow). The might here is the right wording: Whether the infinity
 * marker propagates depends on the traversal order, i.e. whether the
 * corresponding cells have been visited before (then, infinity is not propagated)
 * or is processed afterward.
 *
 * Two properties hold for vertices marked with infinity:
 *
 * - We may not use them for our bucket sort. See analyse().
 * - We cannot make any statement on the linear surplus for infinity nodes,
 *   i.e. whether they have to be refined or not.
 *
 * In rare cases, our discussion implies that adaptivity patterns become
 * unsymmetric even though the problem itself has symmetry. This is due to the
 * fact that the infinity propagates along the cells not handled yet. In this
 * case, it helps to tweak the refinement conditions to yield a more regular
 * adaptivity pattern.
 *
 * If you want to plot the linear surplus, please add an additional if branch
 * where you exclude inf vertices on purpose. But be aware that the infinity
 * there is not a bug.
 *
 * The inf discussion reveals that we can use this behaviour for some balancing:
 * Whenever we encounter inf on an unrefined vertex, we can refine this one.
 * Such a strategy successively removes the infs from the grid, but it induces
 * a very smooth adaptivity pattern, i.e. it is way more aggressive than plain
 * 3:1 balancing. You can switch this behaviour on/off in the constructor of the
 * criterion. By default, it is switched off.

     * Analyse a vertex and derive action to be taken

     * Please call this operation solely for inside vertices. I also recommend

     * small residual, i.e. for converged solutions. Or, alternatively, only

     * grid structure oscillations.
     *
     *
     * !!! Analysis Workflow
     *
     * - Check whether the vertex is refined though the surrounding cells are smaller than the minimum mesh size. If so, coarse it.
     * - Check whether the vertex is unrefined though the surrounding cells are bigger than the maximum mesh size. If so, refine it.
     * - Check whether the vertex holds inf as surplus (see getLinearSurplusContributionFromFineGrid()). If so, leave it as it is.
     * - If all this does not hold:
     *   - Update the local attribute _surplusMaximumOnFineGrid.
     *   - If _surplusMaximumOnFineGrid equals 0.0 jump out of analyser, as in this case we cannot do bin sorting.
     *   - Sort into bin and decide what to do.
     *
     * !!! Comparison Details / Vetos
     *
     * As soon as the right bin has been found, a couple of veto constraints
     * have to be checked:
     *
     * - If refine has been derived for a refined vertex or if delete has been
     *   derived for an unrefined vertex, change action into no action.
     * - If the operation wants to refine but the maximum number of refinements
     *   already has been reached, change the refine command into no action.
     * - Each refine induces a smaller mesh width by a factor of three. If this
     *   mesh width is smaller than the minimum mesh width, reject the
     *   refinement command and change it into no action. For this analysis, we
     *   have to devide the current mesh width by 3.0, as this operation always
     *   is called for an unrefined vertex which then becomes a coarse grid
     *   vertex.
     * - If a delete is derived, this delete is derived for an already refined
     *   vertex. If the adjacent cells have a mesh width that is bigger than
     *   the maximum mesh width, it would not be a good idea to make the mesh
     *   coarser here. In this case, we change the action into no action. For
     *   the check, h does not have to be rescaled.

     * restricted it to all parents, it would depend on the sfc whether which
     * parents are addressed. For symmetric problems, this inevitable leads to
     * non-symmetric restrictions of the linear surplus and, thus, to

     * I thus stick with an averaging over $5^d$ points for one coarse grid vertex.
