\chapter{FAQs (programmers' point of view)}


\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Where is the information whether a point or face is at the
  boundary or not?}.
  I do not provide any such feature. Many codes for example use the grid to
  represent complicated domains, and thus would need such a feature anyway. So
  what you have to do is to add a bool to each vertex/face and set this boolean
  yourself.
  \item To be continued \dots
\end{itemize}
