\chapter{FAQs (programmers' point of view)}



\section{General}


\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Is there any profiling/debugging support within \Peano?} I'm
  planning to support ITAC tags/macros one day in the core, but at the moment
  there's no particular debugging support. You have to be sure you link against
  the release libraries of Peano (use the \texttt{Release} mode in your Python
  script if you use Python and select which library to link against), and you
  might want to switch to the
  Google Chrome output (Chapter \ref{section:logging:logging-devices}). The
  latter gives you some nice timelines. Please note that the release version
  still does dump some data (cmp.~Chapter
  \ref{chapter:installation:build-variants}) which you have to disable manually.

\section{C++ core}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Where is the information whether a point or face is at the
  boundary or not?}.
  I do not provide any such feature. Many codes for example use the grid to
  represent complicated domains, and thus would need such a feature anyway. So
  what you have to do is to add a bool to each vertex/face and set this boolean
  yourself.
