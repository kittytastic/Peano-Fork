\chapter{FAQs (programmers' point of view)}



% \section{General}
% 
% 
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item \textbf{Is there any profiling/debugging support within \Peano?} I'm
%   planning to support ITAC tags/macros one day in the core, but at the moment
%   there's no particular debugging support. You have to be sure you link against
%   the release libraries of Peano (use the \texttt{Release} mode in your Python
%   script if you use Python and select which library to link against), and you
%   might want to switch to the
%   Google Chrome output (Chapter \ref{section:logging:logging-devices}). The
%   latter gives you some nice timelines. Please note that the release version
%   still does dump some data (cmp.~Chapter
%   \ref{chapter:installation:build-variants}) which you have to disable manually.

\section{C++ core}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Where is the information whether a point or face is at the
  boundary or not?}
  I do not provide any such feature. Many codes for example use the grid to
  represent complicated domains, and thus would need such a feature anyway. So
  what you have to do is to add a bool to each vertex/face and set this boolean
  yourself.

\section{Parallelisation}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Why do I (temporarily) get an adaptive grid even though I
  specify a regular one?}
  This phenomenon arises if your adaptive refinements and (dynamic) load
  balancing happen at the same time. Load balancing is realised by transfering a
  whole tree part (subpartition incl.~coarser scales) to another rank after a
  grid sweep. Refinement happens in multiple stages: After a grid traversal, the
  rank takes all the refinement instructions and then realises them throughout
  the subsequent grid sweep. So if a rank gets a refinement command and then
  gives away parts of its mesh, then it might not be able to realise this 
  refinement. At the same time, the rank accepting the new partition is not
  aware of the refinement requests yet. So it might get the refinement
  request, but with one step delay: It sets up the local partition, evaluates
  the refinement criterion, is informed about a refinement wish for this
  area, and subsequently realises it. For most codes, that delay by one
  iteration is not a problem as the newly established rank will just realise the
  refinement one grid sweep later, but the point is:
  refine and erase commands in \Peano\ are always a wishlist to the kernel. The
  kernel can decide to ignore it---at least for one grid sweep.
  \item \textbf{Why do I get imbalanced partitions even though I tried to tell
  my load balancer of choice to balance brilliantly?}
  \Peano\ is based upon three-partitioning, i.e.~whenever it refines a cell it
  yields $3^d$ new cells. Most users scale up in multiples of two. As $3^d$
  cannot be divided into two equally-sized chunks, we always have some
  imbalance.
  \item \textbf{Why do some load balancing schemes report that they have to
  extrapolate data?} 
  A typical message you get is ``global number of cells lags behind local one.
  \ldots ''' Most of my toolbox load balancing relies on asynchronous
  (non-blocking) collectives to gather information about the total grid
  structure. As a consequence, this information always might lag behind the
  actual status quo (load balancing info is sent out while the mesh refines,
  e.g.). Some load balancing schemes can detect such inconsistencies---they only
  arise due to AMR and typically are sorted out an iteration later anyway---and
  apply heuristics. If they detect that the global cell number seems to be too
  small, e.g., they assume that every rank meanwhile has refined once more and
  multiply the global cell count with $3^d$.
