\label{chapter:exaclaw}

ExaClaw is an extension of \ExaHyPE\ (Chapter \ref{chapter:exahype}) which
offers the ClawPack Riemann solvers within \ExaHyPE.
Its development has been made possible by EPSRC under the Excalibur
Phase I call.
The grant number is EP/V00154X/1.

% \begin{remark}
%  To use ClawPack's Riemann solvers within \ExaHyPE/\Peano, we will use the

% The preparation is a summary of the minimal steps you have to run to use
% ExaClaw. 
% Please read through the extensive documentation at
% \url{https://www.clawpack.org/installing.html}.
% For ExaClaw, we download ClawPack, and build and install its Fortran part:
% 
% \begin{code}
% pip install --src=$HOME/clawpack_src --user -e \ 
%   git+https://github.com/clawpack/clawpack.git@v5.6.1#egg=clawpack-v5.6.1
% \end{code}
% 
% export CLAW=$HOME/clawpack_src/clawpack-v5.6.1
% export FC=gfortran
