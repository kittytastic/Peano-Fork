\subsection{Quick ('n not so dirty)}

\noindent
Peano by default keeps track of many grid statistics if you compile with
\texttt{-DTrackGridStatistics}.
For many codes, this is kind of an overkill: they do not require the whole
computer to keep track of all cells and vertices all the time, or, if they need
such data, they require more precise data; data also distinguishing more vertex
types than outer, inner, boundary, e.g.

If you don't need the state's getters on mesh width, number of vertices, and so
forth, try a recompile without \texttt{-DTrackGridStatistics}.


\subsection{Tailor your event specifications}

Before you start any optimisation, please run through all your mappings. 
Each mapping has a couple of specification routines that tells Peano whether
you have implemented the corresponding event, on which data is works (all
scales or only the leaves).
It is worth to make this as restrictive as possible to eliminate as many
operation evaluations as possible.
We assume that you have already specified the right shared memory concurrency
there.
