Peano4's core is a plain C++ application using MPI plus a shared memory
library, as well as HDF5, vtk, and so forth.
It depends how your code is configured.
These underlying libraries/APIs are hidden away from user code by the core.
At the same time, we provide a Python API which hides away most of the core.
At one point, you will however be required to program Peano directly with C++. 
It is just some high-level extensions which hide away all C++ and instead
provide Python (or Fortran) interfaces.


While I document some of the C++ rationale and ideas as well as features, most
users can first safely discuss all the C++ chapters and directly jump to the
application examples which are modelled through the Python interface.
