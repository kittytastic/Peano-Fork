\noindent
\Peano's core is a plain C++ application using MPI plus a shared memory
library.
It can add support for HDF5, vtk, and so forth;
depends how your code is configured.
These underlying libraries/APIs are hidden away from user code by the core.
At the same time, we provide a Python API which hides away most of the core.
At one point, you will however be required to program \Peano\ directly with C++. 


In the following sections, I run through some of the C++ techniques and features
of \Peano.
Many users will never see the majority of them, as they are hidden away---in
particular if you work with high-level wrappers around \Peano\ such as \ExaHyPE.
However, some low-level stuff is interesting for everybody: How to use the
logging and tracing, what support of unit tests does exist, or how to program
dimension-generic loops.
Other stuff is more techi, and serves more as a documentation guideline for core
developers.
Yet, they also provide rationale why certain things in \Peano\ behave the way
they do, once you have a large application up and running.



% While I document some of the C++ rationale and ideas as well as features, most
% users can first safely discuss all the C++ chapters and directly jump to the
% application examples which are modelled through the Python interface.
