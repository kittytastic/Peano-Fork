/**
 * Jacobi smoother
 *
 * Class for an Jacobi smoother we provide for matrix-free methods. Can also be
 * used for explicit time stepping methods where no solver is needed. It enables
 * you to compute the updates to the residuals due to stencils, and it keeps
 * track of the solution, the residual, and the update of the solution due to
 * the Jacobi step in different norms. Finally, it also bookkeeps how many
 * stencil updates have been conducted.
