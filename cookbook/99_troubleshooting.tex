\chapter{Troubleshooting}

\section{PDT}

\begin{itemize}
  \item {\bf The PDT does not pass as the jar file is built with the wrong Java
  version.} Download the whole Peano project (from sourceforge via subversion),
  change into the directory \texttt{pdt}, and run
  \begin{code}
  ant createParser
  ant compile
  ant dist
  \end{code}
  Use the \texttt{pdt.jar} from the \texttt{pdt} directory now. 
\end{itemize}



\section{Programming}

\begin{itemize}
  \item {\bf How can I find out the location of a cell}. See the documentation
  of the \texttt{VertexEnumerator}. The object has routines to query cell
  position, size and level in the spacetree.
\end{itemize}
