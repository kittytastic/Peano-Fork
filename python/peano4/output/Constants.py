    Represents all constants that a Project exports from the Python
    script into C++. I do provide routines to export defines or 
    constants (via constexpr). For the latter, I rely on the auto 
    type word unless you use a specialised routine for a particular 
    type. 
    
    Each project has one instance of Constants, so you can always 
    add/export new constants with
    
    my_project.constants.export ...
    
    Constants also allows you to add defines (precompiler statements).
