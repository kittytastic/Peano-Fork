  """
  This class assumes that you have NxNxN patch within your block. It also assumes that 
  you have an 2MxNxN patch on your faces. M<N. The code interprets these face-associated
  data as overlap with the patch, hooks into touchCellLastTime, and projects the cell's
  patch data onto the overlap (simple copy). 
  
  And then runs over your grid and maps the patch data on the respective entries of the 
  face patch which is an auxiliary data structure.

  patch_overlap  Instance of peano4.datamodel.Patch. Consult remark above about how the
